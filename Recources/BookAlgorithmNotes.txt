Assume communication reliable

It doesn’t matter whether send/revieve or broadcast

Chapter 12 Impossibility: no purly asyncronous algorithm can work correctly

Pulls a lot from chapters 7, 12, 17

Models and proof methods The material on formal models and proof methods is presented in separate chapters--Chapters 
2, 8, 9, 14, and 23 heading the major subdivisions of the book (synchronous network algorithms, asynchronous shared memory algorithms, 
asynchronous network algorithms, and partially synchronous algorithms).

Chapter 21 general assumptions

Assume communication reliable

It doesn’t matter whether send/revieve or broadcast for computability



More specific
Model assume 
	• asynchronous 
	• broadcast system (does broadcast have FIFO)
	• reliable broadcast channels
	• process stopping failures (modeled wit stop events).

Could have done send/receive instead of broadcast with FIFO. what about broadcast without FIFO
Same for computability
